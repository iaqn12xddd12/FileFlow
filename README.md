## Overview

FileFlow is a tool designed to help you visualize and manage file-to-file import dependencies within your Python projects. By utilizing only the standard library, FileFlow generates a clear diagram and a Markdown report that outlines how files within your project interact with each other. This tool is perfect for developers looking to understand their codebase better and ensure all dependencies are verified.

   ```bash
   python fileflow.py
   ```

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage

Using FileFlow is straightforward. Once you have it installed, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Python project directory.
2. Run the FileFlow script:

   ```bash
   python path/to/fileflow.py
   ```

3. After execution, check the generated diagram and Markdown report in the output directory.

### Command Line Options

FileFlow supports several command line options:

- `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit.
- `-o`, `--output`: Specify the output directory for the report and diagram.
- `-f`, `--format`: Choose the format of the report (Markdown or HTML).

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how FileFlow works:

1. Create a sample Python project with the following structure:

   ```
   my_project/
   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py
   â””â”€â”€ data/
       â””â”€â”€ process.py
   ```

2. In `main.py`, import the `utils` module:

   ```python
   from utils import helper_function
   ```

3. In `process.py`, import the `main` module:

   ```python
   from ..main import main_function
   ```

4. Run FileFlow:

   ```bash
   python path/to/fileflow.py
   ```

5. Check the output directory for the generated diagram and Markdown report.
